# Python Chat Application with Qt Designer

## Overview

This project is a real-time chat application developed in Python, using PyQt5 and Qt Designer for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to communicate in a shared chat room, with features that ensure a smooth and intuitive messaging experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant communication with other users in the chat room.
- **User-friendly GUI**: A clean and intuitive interface designed with Qt Designer, ensuring ease of use for all users.
- **Multi-user Support**: Multiple users can join and participate in the same chat room simultaneously.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 (Install via pip)
- `pip` package manager

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-app.git
   cd chat-app
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   To start the chat application, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The GUI will launch, allowing you to enter your username and join the chat room.

## Usage

### Launching the Application

- After running the application (`python main.py`), a login window will appear where you can enter your username and password if you have an account and join the chat room.

### Sending and Receiving Messages

- **Sending Messages**: Type your message into the input box and click the `Send` button to send it.
- **Receiving Messages**: Messages from other users will appear in the chat window in real-time.

## GUI Design

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the chat application was designed using Qt Designer, a powerful tool for designing user interfaces. The `.ui` file generated by Qt Designer defines the layout and components of the interface. This file is loaded in the Python application using the PyQt5 library.
